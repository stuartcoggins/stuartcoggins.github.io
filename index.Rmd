## Introduction

- You may find yourself in a situation where you need some random numbers from a normal distribution
- You also want to specify the mean and the standard deviation of those numbers
- My random number generator has this function

--- .class #id 

## Generating random numbers manually

The following R code produces some random normally distributed numbers:

```{r}
rnorm(10)
```

But it would be preferable if we had an online tool with controls that made it easier to change parameters.

--- .class #id
## Where to find the tool

You can find the random number generator at https://stuartcoggins.shinyapps.io/dataproducts
